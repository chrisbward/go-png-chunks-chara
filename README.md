# go-png-chunks-chara
Reads and writes embedded data in PNGs for AI Character Card, V1 &amp; V2 spec

Leverages [go-png-chunks](https://github.com/chrisbward/go-png-chunks) to read tEXt chunks from PNG, and then marshalls the b64 encoded data of the [Character Card V1 & V2 spec](https://github.com/malfoyslastname/character-card-spec-v2/blob/main/spec_v2.md) to a `CharacterCardV1V2` struct.

Example usage;

```go



```
